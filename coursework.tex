\section{Coursework (15\% + 25\%)}

There are two pieces of coursework which you will have to complete during Term 2 and submit through Tabula. You will receive feedback for the first coursework before the second coursework is due.

\subsection{Mastermind (15\%)}

\paragraph{Description} You have to implement Knuth's five-guess algorithm to complete a program in which a human player takes turns playing the board game mastermind against the computer. 

\paragraph{Aims} This coursework is designed to test your ability to write basic Haskell programs using built-in functions, translate pseudocode into a functional programming language, write recursive functions, and make effective use of lazy evaluation. 

\subsection{Scratch clone (25\%)}

\paragraph{Description} Scratch is a popular tool for teaching programming to children. For this coursework, you have to implement an interpreter for a simple programming language which is used to complete a clone of Scratch. 

\paragraph{Aims} This tests your ability to make use of type classes, data types, and functional design patterns such as monads.
