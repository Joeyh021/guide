\section{Exam (60\%)}

The exam is worth 60\% of the module and takes place in Term 3. You will have to answer any four out of six questions. Each question is worth 25 marks. Past exam papers as well as a sample exam paper are available on the module website. You may also be able to find exam papers from before 2017/18, but note that their format and content are significantly different.

In general, I prefer to set exam questions which require you to use your understanding of functional programming and Haskell to solve problems of varying difficulties. There may be few or no questions that are bookwork and there will be no lengthy essay questions for you to answer. To lessen the need for memorisation, you are permitted to take this guide into the exam with you. A reference of the Haskell standard library may be found in \Cref{ch:prelude}.

There will be three revision lectures in Term 3, the dates of which are to be confirmed. You are welcome to suggest topics for these.
