\section{Exam (60\%)}

The exam is worth 60\% of the module and takes place in Term 3. You will have to answer any four out of six questions. Each question is worth 25 marks. Last year's CS256 exam paper as well as a sample exam paper is available on the module website. There are also exam papers from before 2017/18, but note that their format and content are significantly different.

In general, I prefer to set exam questions which require you to use your understanding of functional programming and Haskell to solve problems of varying difficulties. There may be little to no questions that are bookwork and there will be no lengthy essay questions for you to answer.

There will be at least two revision lectures in Term 3, the dates of which are to be confirmed. You are welcome to suggest topics for these.
